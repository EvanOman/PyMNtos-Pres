# PyMNtos Presentation

This repo contains all of my code for a PyMNtos presentation on 5/12/16 entitled: Pretty Pictures with NumPy

You can see the rendered slideshow for the presentation [here](http://www.evanoman.com/Presentations/PyMNtosPresentation.html).

For those intererested, this talk is based on some tools I used for my graduate research, for more Dynamical Systems code check out my [research repository](https://github.com/EvanOman/Dynamical-Systems-Research).

Please free to contact me with any questions or suggestions, I am always looking to learn or help others learn!
